## Motivation
After working on a project which required patterns in the style of those created by the Memphis Group, I thougth it would be an interesting challenge to come up with a randomizer for those graphics.
I chose "paper.js" and wrote a minimal page with two buttons. One is for a random pattern which you can download as an SVG by clicking the other.
Value Sliders might be included when I find some time.
